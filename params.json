  "body": "<img src=\"https://raw.github.com/informaticameg/plasta/master/resources/plasta.png\" />\r\n\r\nPlasta is a framework written in Python for rapid deployment of [CRUDs]((http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)) in a simple way, in a few steps and in few lines of code.\r\n\r\nIs designed with the MVC pattern and the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) development technique.\r\n\r\n## Sinopsis\r\n\r\nIn software engineering we often find the task of performing various CRUD (Create, read, update and delete) in the development of a typical management system or application. This leads to the repetitive task of writing the same operations over and over again for each CRUD being performed, increasing deployment time, lines of code, risk of errors and increased maintenance.\r\nPlasta born to cover the task of automating these processes.\r\n\r\nIt focuses on both deployment and maintenanceof an aplication is minimized, for this the core of Plasta is designed so that at any time, if necessary, you can reimplement any method that does not meet our interests. Leaving it open to the possibility of a more comfortable development.\r\n\r\n## Technical features\r\n\r\n- [Storm](https://storm.canonical.com/) ORM in the persistence.\r\n\r\n- PyQt4 in GUIs.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Plasta wiki\r\n\r\n## [Introduction](https://github.com/informaticameg/Plasta/blob/master/doc/en/introduction.md)\r\n\r\n* Licence\r\n* Components\r\n* Terminologies\r\n* Conventions \r\n\r\n## [Install](https://github.com/informaticameg/Plasta/blob/master/doc/en/install.md)\r\n\r\n* Using locally\r\n* Using globally\r\n\r\n## [Getting started](https://github.com/informaticameg/Plasta/blob/master/doc/en/getting_started.md)\r\n\r\n* Choosing the structure of the application\r\n* Plasta generator\r\n* [Creating the first package Plasta](https://github.com/informaticameg/plasta/blob/master/doc/en/first_package.md)\r\n\r\n## [Use cases](https://github.com/informaticameg/plasta/blob/master/doc/en/uses_cases.md)\r\n\r\n* Create an object containing references\r\n* Passing reference from one model to another\r\n* Change the order of attributes displayed in the list\r\n* Rename the attributes displayed in the list\r\n* Change the main attribute of the class 'ide' by other\r\n* Formatting attributes in the list\r\n\r\n## [Example Apps](https://github.com/informaticameg/plasta/blob/master/doc/en/example_apps.md)\r\n\r\n* Contact list\r\n* Movements manager\r\n\r\nDocumentation available in Spanish [here](https://github.com/informaticameg/plasta/blob/master/doc/es/index.md)\r\n",
