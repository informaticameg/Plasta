# Plasta

<img src="https://raw.github.com/informaticameg/plasta/master/resources/plasta.png" />

Plasta is a framework written in Python for rapid deployment of [CRUDs]((http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)) in a simple way, in a few steps and in few lines of code.

Is designed with the MVC pattern and the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) development
technique.

## Features

Plasta uses the Storm ORM on data persistence, and the graphic library Qt on graphic interfaces.

It focuses on both deployment and maintenanceof an aplication is minimized, for this the core of Plasta is designed so that at any time, if necessary, you can reimplement any
method that does not meet our interests. Leaving it open to the possibility of a more comfortable development.

Has a number of Qt's .ui files by default ready for use.


## Database Support

Using [Storm ORM](https://storm.canonical.com/), Plasta is conditioned by the support that offers this technology on databases.

For more info see the official [documentation](https://storm.canonical.com/Manual) of Storm.


## Resuming technical features

- [Storm](https://storm.canonical.com/) in the persistence.

- PyQt4 in GUIs.

## Structure of a CRUD

Each CRUD is made up of a Python package, that contains the follow structure:
* Object Class (e.g.: Client).
* Manager Class (e.g.: ClientsManager)
* Main Class of the CRUD (e.g.: ClientsGUI)
* Adding a Record Class (e.g.: AddClient)
* Qt's .ui File for <add client> screen.

Then the resulting package would be something like this:
```
+ /client
|--- __init__.py
|--- manager.py
|--- gui.py
|--- add.py
|--- add.ui
```

**With this structure we're ready to manage Client objects and working with them.**

## Not implemented yet

* Support for cross object references.

## Requirements

Plasta requires:
* Python 2.5 or higher.
* Storm 0.19. Download [here](https://launchpad.net/storm/+download).
* PyQt 4.7. Download [here](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download).
