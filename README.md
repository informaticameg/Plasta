Plasta is a framework written in Python for rapid deployment of [CRUDs]((http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)) in a simple way, in a few steps and in few lines of code.

Is designed with the MVC pattern and the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) development
technique.

## Sinopsis

In software engineering we often find the task of performing various CRUD (Create, read, update and delete) in the development of a typical management system or application. This leads to the repetitive task of writing the same operations over and over again for each CRUD being performed, increasing deployment time, lines of code, risk of errors and increased maintenance.
Plasta born to cover the task of automating these processes.

It focuses on both deployment and maintenanceof an aplication is minimized, for this the core of Plasta is designed so that at any time, if necessary, you can reimplement any method that does not meet our interests. Leaving it open to the possibility of a more comfortable development.

## Database Support

Using [Storm ORM](https://storm.canonical.com/), Plasta is conditioned by the support that offers this technology on databases.

For more info see the official [documentation](https://storm.canonical.com/Manual) of Storm.


## GUI Support

Plasta uses the graphic library Qt on graphic interfaces.

Has a number of Qt's .ui files by default ready for use.

## Resuming technical features

- [Storm](https://storm.canonical.com/) in the persistence.

- PyQt4 in GUIs.

## Structure of a CRUD

Each CRUD is made up of a Python package, that contains the follow structure:
* Object class (e.g.: Client).
* Manager class (e.g.: ClientsManager)
* Main class of the gui CRUD (e.g.: ClientsGUI)
* Adding a record class (e.g.: AddClient)
* Qt's .ui file for <add client> screen.

Then the resulting package would be something like this:
```
/client
|--- __init__.py
|--- manager.py
|--- gui.py
|--- add.py
|--- add.ui
```

**With this structure we're ready to manage Client objects and working with them.**

See [Creating the first package Plasta]() for more details.

## Not implemented yet

* Support for cross object references.
